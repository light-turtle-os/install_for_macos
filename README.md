# install_for_macos
This repository has some Objective-C source code to install TurtleOS on macOS. WARNING: This is a very destructive process and will delete all records of macOS, like deleting all files permanently, deleting all users permanently, etc. Only use this if you are intending to use systems that have configuration that allows you to keep your previous operating system.
